## Linting:

- Linebreak-Style: Every time it was fixed, it would somehow get reverted when pulled from Github. 
- Prop-Types: It was not working properly since I could not determine the type of props being passed. 
- No-undef: Browser localstorage was undefined but it was being used to store the login token
- No-underscore-dangle: '._id' needed to be accessed as userid for mongodb
